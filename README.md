LESSON LEARNED
__________________________________

Used CSS to style the todo List , HTML to organize the text. I used JavaScript to function the toDo list. The to do List organization helps track everyday task. It allows you to delete your mistakes and count how many task you have to do. It toggles (crossout) the list when task is complete and also take away from the total count. 

Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```
